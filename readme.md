### Action

You want to extra control with your application without touching your code you apply Action. Suppose you have a blog editor panel. Where you want add extra buttons from others developer without rewrite your code.
so lets see.


  ```html
  <!-- post.blade.php -->
  <form>
      <div class="form-group">
          <label for="title">Title</label>
          <input type="email" class="form-control" id="title" placeholder="Email">
      </div>

      <div class="form-group">
          <label for="blog">Blog</label>
          <textarea id="blog" cols="30" rows="10" class="form-control"></textarea>
      </div>

      <button type="submit" class="btn btn-default">Publish</button>
      {{hook_action('buttons')}}
  </form>
  ```

  See, here we use `hook_action()` helper function which is register as named `buttons`
  So if others developer is want to add more buttons with this form they will do this
  
  ```php
  use Nahid\Hookr\Facades\Hook;
  
  class BlogController extends Controller
  {
        public function getWritePost()
        {
            Hook::bindAction('buttons', function() {
                echo ' <button class="btn btn-info">Draft</button>';
            }, 2);
            
            return view('post');
       }
  }
  ```
  
  After run this code add new button will add with existing button.

  You can also bind multiple action with this hook. Hookr also support filter. Remind this when you bind multiple filter in a hook then every filter get data from previous filters return data. Suppose you want to add a filter hook in a blog view section.

```
  <h1>{{$blog->title}}</h1>
  <p>
  {{hook_filter('posts', $blog->content)}}
  </p>
```

So we register a filter as 'posts'. Now another developer wants to support markdown for blog posts. so he can bind a filter for parse markdown.


 ```php
  use Nahid\Hookr\Facades\Hook;
  
  class BlogController extends Controller
  {
        public function getPosts()
        {
            Hook::bindFilter('posts', function($data) {
                return parse_markdown($data);
            }, 2);
            
            return view('post');
       }
  }
  ```

  Note: In filter, every callback function must have at least one param which is represent current data

  so if you want to bind multiple data then

   ```php
  use Nahid\Hookr\Facades\Hook;
  
  class BlogController extends Controller
  {
        public function getPosts()
        {
            Hook::bindFilter('posts', function($data) {
                return parse_markdown($data);
            }, 2);

            Hook::bindFilter('posts', function($data) {
                return parse_bbcode($data);
            }, 3);
            
            return view('post');
       }
  }
  ```

  Now then given data is parse by markdown and bbcode. See, here is second param for `bindFilter()` is a priority for binding. Both `bindAction()` and `bindFilter()` has this feature.
